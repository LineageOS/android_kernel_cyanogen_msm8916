AP3426 3-in-1 digital ALS+PS+IRLED module

AP3426 is a module integrated with a digital ambient light sensor, a proximity
sensor, and an IR LED in a single package. It provides multiple gain ambient
light detection as well as external object distance detection. It can be
connected to host processor via i2c.

This is for the CyanogenMod version of the driver, called ap3426_cm.

Required properties:
 - compatible		: Should be "di_ap3426".
 - reg				: i2c slave address of this device.
 - vdd-supply		: Analog power supply needed to power up this device.
 - vio-supply		: Digital IO power supply needed for IO and i2c.
 - interrupt-parent	: The interrupt controler this device connected to.
 - interrupts		: L/P sample interrupt to indicate new data ready.
 - pinctrl-names	: pinctrl configuration names of this device. Should be "default" and "sleep".
 - pinctrl-0		: Should specify pin control groups used for this sensor.
 - pinctrl-1		: Should specify pin control groups used for this sensor.
 - ap3426,irq-gpio	: GPIO pin for interrupt of this device.
 - ap3426,ps-integrated-time: Selects the duration at which the device's ADC will sample the
		photodiode current signal. The maximum value is 63.
 - ap3426,ps-thdl	: Proximity sensor low threshold
 - ap3426,ps-thdh	: Proximity sensor high threshold


Optional properties:
 - ap3426,ps-calibration-min		: Minimum reading for proximity sensor calibration
 - ap3426,ps-calibration-expected	: Expected reading for proximity sensor calibration
 - ap3426,ps-calibration-max		: Maximum reading for proximity sensor calibration

Example:

&i2c_0 { /* BLSP1 QUP2 */
	di_ap3426@1e {
		compatible = "di_ap3426";
		reg = <0x1e>;
		interrupt-parent = <&msm_gpio>;
		interrupts = <113 0x2002>;
		vdd-supply = <&pm8916_l17>;
		vio-supply = <&pm8916_l6>;
		ap3426,irq-gpio= <&msm_gpio 113 0x2002>;
		ap3426,ps-thdl = <100>;
		ap3426,ps-thdh = <200>;
		ap3426,ps-calibration-min = <0>;
		ap3426,ps-calibration-expected = <120>;
		ap3426,ps-calibration-max = <500>;
		ap3426,ps-integrated-time = <0x0>;
	};
};
